This oneliner added to your bashrc will save every command you type to a bash_all_history file in your home directory.
Don't remember where a file came from? grep 'filename' ~/.bash_all_history. Add these aliases to the section alled "User specific aliases and functions".

PROMPT_COMMAND="${PROMPT_COMMAND:+$PROMPT_COMMAND ; }"'echo $USER $PWD "$(history 1)" >> ~/.bash_all_history'

This is a useful alias to have

alias list="ls -alth"
